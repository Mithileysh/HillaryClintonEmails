# RandomForesters
Machine Learning Son

In this directory we have the necessary functions and processses we defined throughout this project in order to do the classification of the emails. 

In the MasterFile.R we have all the code needed to do the processing of the data. We have user-defined functions that prepare our data to be classified, the code needed to do RandomForests, SVM and K-means cluster analysis on the email data. The MasterFile.R document is sourced on the FunctionsFile.R. In this file we have the definition of all the functions we use to do the processing of the data, functions we use in the statistical analysis of Random Forests, SVM and K-means cluster analysis and additional functions that aid us in the creation of illustrative plots.

Besides these two main files, we have supporting files for SVM, namely the files SVM_v2.R, and a file Section and Figures Necessary for report.docx that contains helpful figures included in our final report.
